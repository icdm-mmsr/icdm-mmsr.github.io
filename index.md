title: MMSR â€˜25
subtitle: Workshop on Multimodal Search and Recommendations
---

## Overview

Multimodal search and recommendation (MMSR) systems are at the forefront of modern information retrieval, designed to integrate and process diverse data types such as text, images, audio, and video within a unified framework. This integration enables more accurate and contextually relevant search results and recommendations, significantly enhancing user experiences. For example, e-commerce platforms have started supporting product searches through images to provide a streamlined shopping experience. Recent innovations in LLMs have extended their capabilities to handle multimodal inputs, allowing for a deeper and more nuanced understanding of content and user preferences.

MMSR will be a **half-day** workshop at [ICDM 2025](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~icdm2025/index.html). The workshop will be held on **November 12, 2025** in **Washington DC, USA**. The workshop will explore the latest advancements, challenges, and applications of multimodal search and recommendations.

### Submission Instructions

Papers must be formatted and written according to the Submission Guidelines on the [ICDM 2025 conference web site](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~icdm2025/). You are strongly encouraged to print and double check your PDF file before its submission, especially if your paper contains Asian/European language symbols (such as Chinese/Korean characters or English letters with European fonts).

- Please note that at least **one** author of each accepted paper **must** register for the workshop.

- All accepted workshop papers will be published in the dedicated ICDMW proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.

- Non-archival submissions are not allowed, i.e., all accepted papers will be included and published in the proceedings.
